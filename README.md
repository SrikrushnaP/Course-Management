# Course Management MEAN Stack Application 
The idea behind **course management application** is to create a system that enables us to keep track of the various courses we’re taking online/acadmic.
We used [Angular 18](https://angular.dev/overview), NodeJS 20 , [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
